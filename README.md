# Illness-Death-Surrogacy

This R code provides functions to produce simulation studies as described and shown in "Surrogacy Validation for Time-to-Event Outcomes with Illness-Death Frailty Models" (preprint coming soon).

### Core functionality

The main functions in this repository are written to simulate and run analysis for surrogacy validation of two time-to-event outcomes in a randomized clinical trial.

### Illustration of functions with simulated data

First, data in the illness death format for a randomized trial can be generated using the sim_data.R file. This will provide two datasets that follow the three transitions for each treatment arm. described in the manuscript.

### Simulation Function

The run_sim.R function runs the simulations and performs estimation and surrogacy validation based on our proposed methods.
